We introduce a measurement-free protocol (avoiding projective collapse) to detect decoherence ('drift') in entangled qubit registers, using the conserved arithmetic structure predicted by Spectral Quantum Mechanics~(SQM). In SQM, computational basis states $\ket{n}$ map directly to prime-exponent vectors $\langle a_j(n)\rangle$, causing quantum superpositions to inhabit a prime-logarithmic "spectral space." We show that low-order spectral arithmetic moments, defined as invariants \( I_k = \sum_j f_{k,j}\hat{a}_j \), commute with the SQM Hamiltonian \( H_{\text{LKO}} \). The combination of these invariants with an ancilla oscillator through a dispersive interaction \( H_{\text{int}} = g I_k \otimes \hat{n}_{\text{anc}} \) imprints the spectral moments as measurable Ramsey phases, allowing continuous drift monitoring without projective measurement and thus preserving entanglement.
\paragraph{}
Numerical simulations of two entangled SQM qubits subjected to pure dephasing noise demonstrate that invariant \( I_1 \) reliably flags drift at the \(10^{-4}\) level while maintaining Bell state fidelity greater than \(0.99\). Verified experiments conducted on IBM quantum platforms (\textit{ibm\_brisbane}, \textit{ibm\_sherbrooke}) confirm the predictive precision of our spectral arithmetic drift detection protocol, closely matching theoretical predictions. Additionally, we uncover Spectral Sympathetic Resonance (SSR), a coherent oscillatory effect in spectrally aligned qubits, further supporting SQM's predictive scope. We outline concrete implementation pathways in trapped-ion, circuit-QED, and photonic time-bin architectures, showing that current coherence times and coupling strengths are sufficient for resolving \( I_k \) well within typical qubit lifetimes.
\paragraph{}
The proposed protocol defines a new class of "spectral arithmetic stabilizers," offering an experimentally validated signature of SQM and a scalable pathway toward drift-tolerant quantum computation.
